Description: `tomoseqr` is an R package for analyzing Tomo-seq data.
    Tomo-seq is a genome-wide RNA tomography method that combines combining
    high-throughput RNA sequencing with cryosectioning for spatially resolved transcriptomics.
    `tomoseqr` reconstructs 3D expression patterns from tomo-seq data
    and visualizes the reconstructed 3D expression patterns.
