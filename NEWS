Changes in version 1.11.1 (2022-10-25)
+ Made the following changes:
    o Added 3D visualize function to imageViewer
    o Changed `normCount` and `normMask` options in `estimate3dExpressions()`
        to `normalize` option. When it is `TRUE` (default), the function works as if
        `normCount = "count", normMask = TRUE`. When it is `FALSE`, the
        function works as if `normCount = "none", normMask = FALSE`.
